# Flowers
 This code is a short machine learning project using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify iris flowers based on their dimensions. It loads the Iris dataset, splits it for training and validation, trains an SVM model, makes predictions, and evaluates accuracy using common metrics.
